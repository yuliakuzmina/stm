structural topic modeling

I conducted this research as a course work during my MA study at European University at Saint-Petersburg, Russia. This is the analysis of texts on sex education in Russian media. Using structural topic modeling (STM) I want to reveal when and how it is spoken about sex education (Sex education is not included in the official curriculum). The dataset includes messages from Russian newspapers, magazines, and popular blogs.
